	abstract     = {Near-term quantum computers will soon reach sizes that are challenging to directly simulate, even when employing the most powerful supercomputers. Yet, the ability to simulate these early devices using classical computers is crucial for calibration, validation, and benchmarking. In order to make use of the full potential of systems featuring multi- and many-core processors, we use automatic code generation and optimization of compute kernels, which also enables performance portability. We apply a scheduling algorithm to quantum supremacy circuits in order to reduce the required communication and simulate a 45-qubit circuit on the Cori II super-computer using 8, 192 nodes and 0.5 petabytes of memory. To our knowledge, this constitutes the largest quantum circuit simulation to this date. Our highly-tuned kernels in combination with the reduced communication requirements allow an improvement in time-to-solution over state-of-the-art simulations by more than an order of magnitude at every scale.},

The quantum fan-out operation, which reduces the circuit depth of quantum algorithms such as the quantum Fourier transform and Shor's algorithm, is an example that can be realized in constant depth independent of the output size. Here, we demonstrate a quantum fan-out gate with real-time feedforward on up to four output qubits using a superconducting quantum processor. By performing quantum state tomography on the output states, we benchmark our gate with input states spanning the entire Bloch sphere. We decompose the output-state error into a set of independently characterized error contributions. We extrapolate our constant-depth circuit to offer a scaling advantage compared to the unitary fan-out sequence beyond 25 output qubits with feedforward control, or beyond 17 output qubits if the classical feedforward latency is negligible. Our work highlights the potential of mid-circuit measurements combined with real-time conditional operations to improve the efficiency of complex quantum algorithms.},

In principle, these limitations can be superseded by nonunitary, dynamic circuits. These circuits exploit measurements alongside conditional feed-forward operations, providing a promising approach for long-range entangling gates, higher effective connectivity of near-term hardware, and more efficient state preparations. Here, we explore the utility of shallow dynamic circuits for creating long-range entanglement on large-scale quantum devices. Specifically, we study two tasks: controlled-not gate teleportation between up to 101 qubits by feeding forward 99 midcircuit measurement outcomes, and the preparation of Greenberger–Horne–Zeilinger states with genuine entanglement. In the former, we observe that dynamic circuits can outperform their unitary counterparts. In the latter, by tallying instructions of compiled quantum circuits, we provide an error budget detailing the obstacles that must be addressed to unlock the full potential of dynamic circuits. Looking forward, we expect dynamic circuits to be useful for generating long-range entanglement in the near term on large-scale quantum devices.},

	abstract     = {In dynamic quantum circuits, classical information from midcircuit measurements is fed forward during circuit execution. This emerging capability of quantum computers confers numerous advantages that can enable more efficient and powerful protocols by drastically reducing the resource requirements for certain core algorithmic primitives. In particular, in the case of the 𝑛-qubit quantum Fourier transform followed immediately by measurement, the scaling of resource requirements is reduced from 𝑂⁡(𝑛2) two-qubit gates in an all-to-all connectivity in the standard unitary formulation to 𝑂⁡(𝑛) midcircuit measurements in its dynamic counterpart without any connectivity constraints. Here, we demonstrate the advantage of dynamic quantum circuits for the quantum Fourier transform on IBM’s superconducting quantum hardware with certified process fidelities of {\textgreater}50\% on up to 16 qubits and {\textgreater}1\% on up to 37 qubits, exceeding previous reports across all quantum computing platforms. These results are enabled by our contribution of an efficient method for certifying the process fidelity, as well as of a dynamical decoupling protocol for error suppression during midcircuit measurements and feed forward within a dynamic quantum circuit that we call “feed-forward-compensated dynamical decoupling.” Our results demonstrate the advantages of leveraging dynamic circuits in optimizing the compilation of quantum algorithms.},

	abstract     = {Quantum entanglement is one of the primary features which distinguishes quantum computers from classical computers. In gate-based quantum computing, the creation of entangled states or the distribution of entanglement across a quantum processor often requires circuit depths which grow with the number of entangled qubits. However, in teleportation-based quantum computing, one can deterministically generate entangled states with a circuit depth that is constant in the number of qubits, provided that one has access to an entangled resource state, the ability to perform mid-circuit measurements, and can rapidly transmit classical information. In this work, aided by fast classical FPGA-based control hardware with a feedback latency of only 150 ns, we explore the utility of teleportation-based protocols for generating non-local, multi-partite entanglement between superconducting qubits. First, we demonstrate well-known protocols for generating Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states and non-local CNOT gates in constant depth. Next, we utilize both protocols for implementing an unbounded fan-out (i.e., controlled-NOT-NOT) gate in constant depth between three non-local qubits. Finally, we demonstrate deterministic state teleportation and entanglement swapping between qubits on opposite side of our quantum processor.},
