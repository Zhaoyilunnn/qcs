        This is an internal fast-path function, and it is the responsibility of the caller to
        ensure that all the arguments are valid; there is no error checking here.  In
        particular, all the qubits and clbits must already exist in the circuit and there can be
        no duplicates in the list.

    .. note::

        This function may be used by callers other than :obj:`.QuantumCircuit` when the caller
        is sure that all error-checking, broadcasting and scoping has already been performed,
        and the only reference to the circuit the instructions are being appended to is within
        that same function.  In particular, it is not safe to call
        :meth:`QuantumCircuit._append` on a circuit that is received by a function argument.
        This is because :meth:`.QuantumCircuit._append` will not recognise the scoping
        constructs of the control-flow builder interface.
